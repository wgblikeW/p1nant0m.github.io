### 😏Introduction

Greetings From p1nant0m 🖖 !! I am a Junior student majoring in Information Security. Currently, I am learning about Kubernetes architecture and security issues related to Cloud Native. It's an interesting area that I want to dive into deeply. But I am confused about how I can do more real practices in the specific domain. Also, I used to be a CTF player solving cryptographic challenges, but now I focus more on Web Security and engineering problems. (Mathematics is so sophisticated to me :crying_cat_face: ) But I still do endeavor to post some introduction of cryptography based on what I have learned in the lecture —— Principle of Cryptography (Using the textbook *Introduction To Modern Cryptography* by *Jonathan Katz* ) Besides doing my professional, I am curious about philosophy, history, and sociology. These topics are meaningful since we all humanity are under an unprecedentedly pandemic. We may observe the historical turning or it is exactly happening. By the way, I am working on lab3 from <u>MIT 6.824 Distributed System</u>, in which I have learned a lot of knowledge about design and principles in building highly available distributed systems. What's more, I take this lecture with some perspectives from Security.
